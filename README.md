Control your site with rust

## Get Started

### Add the script

To add the script all you will have to do is add this to your html

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/AMTitan/razer/js/razer.min.js"></script>
```

### Start your server

To start hosting a server go to this url https://github.com/AMTitan/razer/commits/master and on the right you should see
a phrase like `2c69082` this will be different for you but it will be the same length, add this to your Cargo.toml

```toml
razer = { git = "https://github.com/AMTitan/razer", rev = "2c69082" }
```

but replace the `2c69082` with the string you got above

You can read the examples I have made and work off of those
